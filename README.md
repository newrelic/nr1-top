![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-top?include_prereleases) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-top/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-top)

A simple process monitor for New Relic One, similar to the Unix _top_ command.

## Usage
Requires [New Relic Infrastructure agent to be deployed](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent#infra-install) on a monitored host.
